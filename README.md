## **UserStory**

- As a user...
- I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once... 
- So that I have quick access to their information.

## Description

A simple Employee Directory built using React. A table of random users (100 for demonstration purposes) is generated from [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). The contents of the table is rendered to the screen when the page loads.

The user may sort the rendered data either by Date Of Birth (D.O.B.)....

... or by name.

A field is provided to search the table by user name, with the rendered table updating as the search field is entered. The search text will filter the results by any name containing the search string, and is case insensitive
